Welcome to the **Tasks API** – a RESTful API designed to help developers integrate task management functionality into their applications. The API provides secure, scalable access to create, read, update, delete, and manage tasks, with advanced features such as webhooks, filtering, sorting, and bulk operations.

## Purpose
The Tasks API enables teams, project management tools, productivity apps, and workflow systems to automate task handling and integrate task data across platforms.

## General Usage
- All requests are made over HTTPS.
- API responses are returned in JSON format.
- Authentication is required for all endpoints via **OAuth 2.0 (Client Credentials Grant)**.
- Rate limiting applies: **1000 requests per hour** per token.
- Pagination, filtering, and sorting are available for efficient data handling.

## Requirements
- **OAuth 2.0 client credentials** for token generation.
- All dates and times use **ISO 8601 UTC format**.
- Ensure your client handles **HTTP status codes** properly (e.g., `401 Unauthorized`, `429 Too Many Requests`).

## Example Use Cases
- **Task Automation**: Auto-create tasks from user actions or workflows.
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Retrieve task data for dashboards and reports.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Sync tasks between apps, CRMs, or project management tools.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Get notified via webhooks when tasks change status.
- **Bulk Processing**: Manage large datasets of tasks efficiently with batch operations.

## Best Practices & Guidelines
- Use pagination when retrieving large task lists.
- Leverage filtering and sorting to minimize data transfer.
- Securely validate webhook payloads using the provided signature.
- Respect rate limits to avoid service disruption.
- Refresh OAuth tokens before they expire to maintain access.
